    "I choose to run my recommender in a main function. I initially created several multi-step boxes of code using https://analyticsindiamag.com/how-to-build-your-first-recommender-system-using-python-movielens-dataset/ as a guide. However, I chose to transform those steps into a main function:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) to test my abilities with main functions which I haven’t used in several semesters \n",
    "\n",
    "b) so I can differentiate from the steps in my reference website\n",
    "\n",
    "c) to make it more user friendly (the user only has to click a box once to get their recommendation and not several boxes) \n",
    "\n",
    "In the top box of coding (the \"End User Version\"), I’ve commented out where I print the data frame each step of the way to check for accuracy. This is the final version I would present to an end user. I displayed the results of my recommender with the user requesting a valid movie, an invalid movie, and exiting the loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first steps in the main function are the same intro steps in all my coding. I load my modules, set my directory, and load the necessary files as panda data frames. Following these introductory steps are the following functions: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Merge** – This function left merges the ratings_df data frame and the movies_df data frame on the ‘movieID’ column. The function returns the resulting merged_df data frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Features** – This function groups the merged_df data frame by ‘title’ and finds the mean ‘rating’ per ‘title.’ A new column called ‘Total Ratings’ is added which counts the number of ratings per title. The function then returns the resulting average_ratings_df which consist of three columns: ‘title,’ ‘rating,’ and ‘Total Ratings.’ This information is useful as our recommender will only return movies that have at least 100 reviews so outlier reviews don’t skew the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pivot** – This function pivots the merged_df data frame using the ‘userID’ column as the new index, the titles of each movie as the columns, and the ratings of each userID/movie as the data in the body of the pivoted_df data frame. The function returns the pivoted_df which is a very wide data frame with several NaN values in the body as every movie is its own column and values will only populate for each movie that each user has rated. The recommender will use this to find correlations among the movies. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommender** – Now that all the data frames are formatted, this function does what the assignment asks, which is to obtain a movie from the user and recommend 10 similar movies. This function is a loop which asks the user to input the name and release year of a movie they would like recommendations for or type ‘quit’ in any upper/lowercase combination to leave the loop. If the user requests a movie that is not in the database, the loop alerts the user to the error and repeats from the beginning requesting a movie. If the user inputs a movie which is in the database, the loop continues to the recommendation programing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommender cont** – If given a valid movie, the recommender will first calculate the correlation between the requested movie and all other movies in the data frame. It will then convert the correlation series to a data frame and drop the rows with NaN in the correlation column. The ‘Total Ratings’ column from the average_ratings_df will be added to the correlations_df. Movies with less than 100 ratings will be removed to limit the skew of outliers. The data frame will then be sorted so the movies with the highest correlation to the user requested movie will be on top and the lowest correlation will be on bottom. Following the guide at the above website, I then left joined the movies_df on the ‘title’ column so the ‘genre’ and ‘movieID’ columns could be included in the final output. I debated the necessity of this step, but it could be useful if the user is in the mood for a particular genre. I thought of dropping the ‘movieID’ column, but left it in incase the user is familiar with the dataset and refers to the movies by their movieID or if this recommender will be expanded in the future. Finally, the recommender will print the first ten lines of the sorted data frame. Then the loop will start over, and the user can request recommendations for a new movie or opt to exit the loop. "
