Dodd - Miami Housing Price Prediction Video (Random Forest Regression with Hypertuning and Feature Importance)

This project predicts the sale prices of Miami Homes based on their distance to local landmarks. This project is comprised of three files:

1)	Juypter Notebook - The underlying code which scales the data, evaluates the metrics of several regression models, performs a grid search to find the best parameters for a Random Forest Regression model, and initiates a hypertuned Random Forest model.
2)	Powerpoint – A deck which details the findings and deploys a predictive dataframe to predict the price of a Miami home.
3)	Video – A presentation for a Miami Real Estate company detailing how this model would be beneficial to their company and their clients.
